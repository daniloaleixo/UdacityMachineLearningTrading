    "<font color=red>$\\beta_ir_m(t)$ (market)</font>: what the capital assets pricing model is asserting is that a significant portion of the return for a particular stock is due to the market. In other words, the market moving up or down strongly affects the change in price on every individual stock. Every stock has its individual <font color=red>$\\beta$</font> that specifies how much it's affected. For example, if <font color=red>$\\beta$</font> is 2, that means if the market goes up 1%, the stock goes up 2%.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red>$\\alpha_i(t)$ (residual)</font>: if we look at all the stocks over one day and look at how much the market goes up or down, and how much the stock should have gone up or down according to <font color=red>$\\beta$</font>, there will be something left over, which won't exactly match what <font color=red>$\\beta$</font> predicted. That's what <font color=red>$\\alpha$</font> or **`residual component`** is.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red>$E = 0$</font>: an important part of the capital assets pricing model is that the expectation <font color=red>$E$</font> for <font color=red>$\\alpha$</font> is 0, where <font color=red>$E$</font> is a random variable with an expected value of 0.\n",

    "Historically a particular stock looking back at time gave you a particular <font color=red>$\\alpha$</font>, you shouldn't necessarily expect that in the future.<br/>\n",
    "The CAPM says that you should expect <font color=red>$\\alpha$</font> to be 0, it's random and unpredictable. It can be negative or positive, small or large. On average, it's gonna be 0. <br/>\n",

    "We have to consider the different industries. In other words a particular stock might have exposure to different aspects of the market. <br/>\n",
    "For example, the stock might have some exposure to finance, so we could compute the component of return <font color=red>$r_i$</font> due to finance via the <font color=red>$\\beta_{iF}$</font> with regard to finance and the return <font color=red>$r_{iF}$</font> for finance of that day."
